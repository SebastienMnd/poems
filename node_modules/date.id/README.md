### How to use it?

This module is possible to use both in the browser and in node.js, for the browser tutorial please refer to the [Browser Tutorial](#how-to-use-it-in-the-browser), or if you're going to use this in node.js please refer to the [Node.js Tutorial](#how-to-use-it-in-nodejs).

### How to use it in the browser

First step is to add it into your html page.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/ihack2712/date.id/master/src/index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Date.id is imported into the `window` object as `did`

Here's some example usage.
```html
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<title>Date.ID Example</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p id="output" style="font-family:monospace">Hey, press the cool button below that says "Generate" to generate a random DateID.</p>
		<br />
		<input type="button" id="generate" value="Generate" />
		<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/ihack2712/date.id/master/src/index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			const button = document.getElementById('generate');
			const output = document.getElementById('output');
			
			button.onclick = function (event) {
				const randomID = did();
				const message = 'Hey, I generated a random id! Look: <br />' + randomID + '<br /> Why don\'t you press the button again to make a new ID?';
				output.innerHTML = message;
			};
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```
